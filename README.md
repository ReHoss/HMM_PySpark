# HMM_PySpark

Implementation of the transition matrix and emission matrix estimation (Viterbi algorithm) algorithm from the book: [Data-Intensive Text Processing
with MapReduce][1](Jimmy Lin and Chris Dyer). It is a map-reduce based approach. Two distinct implementations are provided: one only using python built-in packages and replicating the book pseudo-code and one using the NumPy libraby and some optimizations.
See the report for a detailed description.

- hmm_python.py: built in python only implementation (no extra package needed). It intents to replicate the map-reduce based implementation from the reference book.

- hmm_numpy.py: numpy based, optimized implementation (recusrive forward-backward algorithm).

- hmm_report.pdf: report explaining model and implementation. Also contains performance comparison and commentaries on the book point of view.
